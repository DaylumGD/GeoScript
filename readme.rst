GeoScript programming language
==============================
Version 1.0

IMPORTANT NOTE
--------------
.. note:: GeoScript currently only works on Windows 10 and 11, this is because as of now we have no other way of decoding the MacOS's Geometry Dash save file if you know or have an idea of how to decode it then please contact me through Discord.

Other note
----------
.. note:: GeoScript is mainly programmed in Python while it is possible to compile Python using PyInstaller it has way too mutch dependencies so you might just have install Python at https://python.org/downloads

What is it?
-----------
GeoScript is a special programming language that compiles straight to Geometry Dash triggers, Sort of like SPWN but esier to learn and up to date with 2.2. GeoScript
is a staticly-typed object-oriented language and has a syntax similar to JavaScript and C++.

Getting Started
---------------
To get started first you need to create a file in any Code/Text editor as long as the file is saved as a .gs file, Then you can create what ever you want with geoscript
you can learn the language basics and the more advanced stuff at https://geoscript.org/learn/intro.

Example Game
############
There is an example game at ./example.gss you can alter it how ever you want. When your comlete what ever your making go into the command line and type
(only works with GeoScript installed),

.. code-block:: shell
    geoscript build your_file.gs level_name

When you launch Geometry Dash again and open the level you just compiled you should see the finished result of the compiler
