GeoScript Programming Language
==============================
GeoScript version 1.0

What is it?
------------
GeoScript is an open-source programming language that compiles straight to Geometry Dash triggers. First
started work in December 2023 and fully relised in Janurary 2024 by Daniel Rees. It was made to create
complex and detailed visuals in Geometry Dash levels and to make more complex minigames easier to make
it makes your project more readable than the normal GD editor. The compiler and everything in the project
was coded in Python.

Getting started
----------------
First before you do anything is to setup GeoScript: First run GeoInstaller.exe and follow all the steps.
[MAKE SHURE YOU HAVE AND ARE SIGNED INTO YOUR GD ACCOUNT]

Once finished setting up GeoScript what you want to do is create your first GeoScript file by creating a file 
in any code editor and giving it the .gs file extension then start coding learn GeoScript by reading 
`doc: Documentation/Tutorial.txt` or visit https://geoscript.taipy.cloud/documentation/tutorial/introduction
(has examples and images in it)

When you want to run your code run GeoCompiler.exe, choose Compile, Enter the file location of your .gs file,
enter the name of the level you want to compile to (could also get the program to create a level for you) then
once finished play your level.

GSPI
-----
GSPI or GeoScript Package Installer is a free peice of software embedded in GeoCompiler where you can upload
to a database full of other projects where you can remotely download modules onto your device you don't need
an account or anything and it's completely free!!

Important notes
----------------
This only works on Windows and won't work on mac even if you have an emulator it I will create a mac
version when a method of decoding CCLocalLevels.dat is found that works on mac
